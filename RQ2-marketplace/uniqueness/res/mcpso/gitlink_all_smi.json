This capability makes it indispensable for scenarios where unbiased, unpredictable outcomes are critical, and where LLM approximations (hallucinations) simply won\u2019t suffice.\n\nFortunaMCP is perfectly suited for tasks like Monte Carlo simulations, complex system modeling and analysis, and interactive game mechanics.
