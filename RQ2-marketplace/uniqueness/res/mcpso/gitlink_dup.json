FortunaMCP provides dependable randomness for a wide range of AI applications.\n\nLarge language models excel at natural language processing but rely on deterministic algorithms that fall short when true unpredictability is required. In contrast, FortunaMCP delivers genuine randomness. This capability makes it indispensable for scenarios where unbiased, unpredictable outcomes are critical, and where LLM approximations (hallucinations) simply won\u2019t suffice.\n\nFortunaMCP is perfectly suited for tasks like Monte Carlo simulations, complex system modeling and analysis, and interactive game mechanics. It is not intended for blockchain, security or encryption oriented tasks."
