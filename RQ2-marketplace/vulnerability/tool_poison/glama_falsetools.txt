Must be one of:\n    - \'iqr\': Interquartile Range - Identifies outliers based on distribution quartiles\n    - \'zscore\': Z-score - Identifies outliers based on standard deviations from the mean\n    - \'isolation_forest\': Machine learning approach that isolates anomalies using random forest\n  * `sensitivity` (float, Optional, default: 1.5): For \'iqr\' method, the multiplier for the IQR to define outlier bounds.\n    - Higher values are less sensitive (1.5 is standard, 3.0 would detect only extreme outliers)\n  * `threshold` (float, Optional, default: 3.0): For \'zscore\' method, the threshold for Z-scores to define outliers.\n    - Higher values are less sensitive (3.0 is standard, 2.0 would detect more outliers)\n  * `window_size` (int, Optional, default: 20): Size of rolling window for detection methods.\n    - If not provided, uses global statistics\n    - Smaller windows (e.g., 7-14) detect local anomalies, larger windows detect global anomalies\n  * `contamination` (float, Optional, default: 0.05): For \'isolation_forest\' method, the expected proportion of anomalies.\n    - Values typically range from 0.01 (1%) to 0.1 (10%)\n\n### Returns:\nA JSON string containing the anomaly detection results and metadata.\n- `result`: Dictionary with structure for each analyzed column:\n  ```\n  {\n    column_name: {\n      "timestamps": [...],  # List of datetime values\n      "values": [...],      # List of numeric values\n      "is_anomaly": [...],  # Boolean flags indicating anomalies\n      "anomaly_score": [...], # Scores indicating degree of deviation\n      "summary": {\n        "total_points": int,\n        "anomaly_count": int,\n        "percentage": float,\n        "method": str      # Method used for detection\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- `metadata`: Includes `execution_time`, `query_type` (\'anomaly_detection\'), `source_type`, `anomaly_method`.')
('recommend_tracks', 'Recommends music tracks based on specified track IDs or can use the user\'s TIDAL favorites if no IDs are provided.\n\nUSE THIS TOOL WHENEVER A USER ASKS FOR:\n- Music recommendations\n- Track suggestions\n- Music similar to their TIDAL favorites or specific tracks\n- "What should I listen to?"\n- Any request to recommend songs/tracks/music based on their TIDAL history or specific tracks\n\nThis function gets recommendations based on provided track IDs or retrieves the user\'s \nfavorite tracks as seeds if no IDs are specified.\n\nWhen processing the results of this tool:\n1. Analyze the seed tracks to understand the music taste or direction\n2. Review the recommended tracks from TIDAL\n3. IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any tracks from the seed tracks in your recommendations\n4. Ensure there are NO DUPLICATES in your recommended tracks list\n5. Select and rank the most appropriate tracks based on the seed tracks and filter criteria\n6. Group recommendations by similar styles, artists, or moods with descriptive headings\n7. For each recommended track, provide:\n   - The track name, artist, album\n   - Always include the track\'s URL to make it easy for users to listen to the track\n   - A brief explanation of why this track might appeal to the user based on the seed tracks\n   - If applicable, how this track matches their specific filter criteria       \n8. Format your response as a nicely presented list of recommendations with helpful context (remember to include the track\'s URL!)\n9. Begin with a brief introduction explaining your selection strategy\n10. Lastly, unless specified otherwise, you should recommend MINIMUM 20 tracks (or more if possible) to give the user a good variety to choose from.\n\n[IMPORTANT NOTE] If you\'re not familiar with any artists or tracks mentioned, you should use internet search capabilities if available to provide more accurate information.\n\nArgs:\n    track_ids: Optional list of TIDAL track IDs to use as seeds for recommendations.\n              If not provided, will use the user\'s favorite tracks.\n    filter_criteria: Specific preferences for filtering recommendations (e.g., "relaxing music," \n                     "recent releases," "upbeat," "jazz influences")\n    limit_per_track: Maximum number of recommendations to get per track (NOTE: default: 20, unless specified otherwise, we\'d like to keep the default large enough to have enough candidates to work with)\n    limit_from_favorite: Maximum number of favorite tracks to use as seeds (NOTE: default: 20, unless specified otherwise, we\'d like to keep the default large enough to have enough candidates to work with)\n    \nReturns:\n    A dictionary containing both the seed tracks and recommended tracks')
